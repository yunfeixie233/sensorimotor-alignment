    This processor acts as a container that applies a sequence of other
    processors serially. It is useful for building complex model I/O pipelines
    from smaller, reusable components. ``pre_process`` is applied from left to
    right, while ``post_process`` is applied in reverse order so the output
    transformation mirrors the input transformation stack.

    The composed processor preserves the standard processor call semantics:
    child ``pre_process`` methods are fed one sample at a time before
    collation, while child ``post_process`` methods usually receive batched
    model outputs and collated model inputs.
