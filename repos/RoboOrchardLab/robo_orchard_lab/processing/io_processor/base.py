    This class defines the standard interface for processors that encapsulate
    the pre-processing and post-processing logic required around a model. The
    primary role of a model I/O processor is to convert raw, user-provided or
    dataset-provided data into a format suitable for model consumption and to
    convert raw model outputs into a more user-friendly, structured
    representation.

    In the standard inference pipeline workflow, :meth:`pre_process` is
    called once per raw sample before any collate function runs, so subclasses
    should usually treat its input as a single sample. By contrast,
    :meth:`post_process` runs after model forward and therefore commonly sees
    batched model inputs and batched model outputs produced after collation,
    even when the batch size is 1.

    Concrete processors are used directly by inference pipelines and may also
    be reused by training or evaluation step processors.
