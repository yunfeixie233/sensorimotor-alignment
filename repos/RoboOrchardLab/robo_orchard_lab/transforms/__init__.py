"""Transform module.

A Transform is a callable that takes an input and returns a transformed output.

Usually transforms are used to preprocess the input data before feeding
it into a model. The data loader usually applies dataset-specific transforms
to the input data, such as decoding, resizing, cropping, etc, to normalize
the input data to a specific format.
