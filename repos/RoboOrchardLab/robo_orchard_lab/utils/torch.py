    This function traverses common nested data structures such as dictionaries,

    `.to(device)` method. Other data types within the structure are
    returned unmodified.

        data (Any): The data structure to move. It can be a `torch.Tensor`,
            a dictionary, a list, a tuple, or other basic types.
        device (torch.device): The target device to which tensors should be
            moved (e.g., `torch.device('cuda:0')` or `torch.device('cpu')`).

    Returns:
        Any: A new data structure of the same type and shape as `data`, but
             with all `torch.Tensor` instances located on the target device.
