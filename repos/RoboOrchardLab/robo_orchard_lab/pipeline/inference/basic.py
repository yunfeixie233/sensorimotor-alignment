    """A concrete end-to-end inference pipeline.

    Like ``Pipeline`` in Hugging Face Transformers, this class provides a
    user-friendly interface for performing inference with a model while
    handling the surrounding runtime steps such as pre-processing, batching,
    model forwarding, and post-processing.

    The defined workflow in :meth:`__call__` is:

    1. Pre-process the raw input data using the configured processor.
    2. Collate the processed data into a mini-batch when batching is needed.
    3. Perform model inference.
    4. Post-process the model's output using the processor.

    In this workflow, ``processor.pre_process`` is invoked once per raw
    sample before collation. ``processor.post_process`` runs after model
    forward, so it usually receives batched model outputs together with the
    collated model input, even when the effective batch size is 1.
