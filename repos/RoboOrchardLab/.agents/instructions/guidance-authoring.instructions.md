# Guidance Authoring Instructions

## Guidance Model

- Treat this repository as an independent guidance root.
- Keep local `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/instructions/`, `.agents/references/`, and `.agents/skills/`
  self-contained; do not rely on any containing workspace or parent
  repository to make the wording complete.
- When borrowing a rule from another repository, rewrite it so it remains
  accurate for this repository's own layout, tooling, and ownership model.

## AGENTS.md Responsibilities

- Use `AGENTS.md` for scope, precedence, routing, and discovery entrypoints.
- Keep detailed behavior rules in `.agents/instructions/` or
  `.agents/skills/`, not in `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep `Quick Routing` limited to topics owned by this repository.
- If `AGENTS.md` says a local `.agents/instructions/`, `.agents/references/`, or `.agents/skills/`
  tree exists, make sure the referenced paths actually exist.
- Keep `source of truth` and `independent repository` wording consistent
  with the no-parent-fallback model.

## Instruction Files

- Use `.agents/instructions/*.md` for detailed rules, constraints, and
  workflow expectations.
- Keep `.agents/*` and `AGENTS.md` as concise as possible while preserving
  scope, precedence, routing, and discoverability.
- Keep each file focused on repository-specific behavior or a clearly
  scoped topic instead of duplicating broad guidance without need.
- Prefer one clear routing entry over repeated topic lists across `Read
  First`, `Quick Routing`, and repository notes when the repeated text does
  not add repository-specific meaning.
- Keep the front-matter `description` aligned with the actual scope of the
  file after edits.
- Prefer updating or deleting stale guidance over leaving broader text that
  no longer matches the body.

## Skill Files

- Use `.agents/skills/*` for independent workflows or task playbooks, not
  for restating general instruction text.
- Reference skills from `AGENTS.md` so discovery stays explicit.
- If multiple local skills overlap, make the intended routing clear in
  `AGENTS.md`.

## Reference Files

- Use `.agents/references/*` for stable, agent-facing terminology, naming guidance, checklists, and short decision summaries.
- Keep reference files concise and specific enough that `AGENTS.md` or a skill can link to them directly.

## Temporary Design Drafts And Retrospectives

- Temporary design drafts and one-off task retrospectives are not shared agent guidance.
- Keep in-progress design notes in a disposable scratch path such as `.agents/scratch/designs/` while the task is active, then delete them after confirmation.
- Promote stable project-facing knowledge into `docs/`, package docs, or another established design-doc location for this repository.
- Distill stable agent-facing lessons into local instructions or other intentional local shared agent assets as appropriate, not raw scratch notes.

## Consistency Checks

- After editing guidance, read the affected `AGENTS.md`, instruction files,
  reference files, and skill references together to check for duplicate rules,
  contradictory precedence, and mismatched scope.
- Verify that every referenced file path exists and that every listed local
  tree actually exists.
- Check that `Quick Routing`, `Read First`, and `Repository Notes` all
  describe the same ownership and fallback model.
- Confirm the guidance still reads coherently when this repository is
  viewed on its own, without any parent-workspace context.
