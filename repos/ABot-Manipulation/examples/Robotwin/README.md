# 🚀 RoboTwin 2.0 Evaluation

This document provides instructions for reproducing our **experimental results** with [RoboTwin2.0](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin).  
The evaluation process consists of two main parts:  

1. Setting up the `robotwin` environment and dependencies.  
2. Running the evaluation by launching services in both `ABot` and `robotwin` environments.  

We have verified that this workflow runs successfully on **NVIDIA 4090** GPUs.

# Evaluation

## ⬇️ 0. Download Checkpoints
Please download Checkpoint from [🤗 ABot-M0-Robotwin2](https://huggingface.co/acvlab/ABot-M0-RoboTwin2). You should replace the `base_vlm` in the `config.yaml` file with your own path.

## 📦 1. Environment Setup

To set up the environment, please first follow the [official RoboTwin installation guide](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/robotwin-install.html) to install the base `robotwin` environment.  

than pip install additional requirements

```bash
pip install -r examples/Robotwin/eval_files/requirements.txt
```

and edit `ROBOTWIN_PATH` in `examples/Robotwin/eval_files/eval.sh`.

## 🚀 2. Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1. Start the server (ABot environment)

In the first terminal, activate the `ABot` conda environment and run:  

```bash
bash examples/Robotwin/eval_files/run_policy_server.sh
```

Edit your checkpoint path in `examples/Robotwin/eval_files/deploy_policy.yml` and `examples/Robotwin/eval_files/run_policy_server.sh`.

---

### Step 2. Start the simulation (robotwin environment)

In the second terminal, activate the `robotwin` conda environment and run:  

```bash
conda activate robotwin
cd examples/Robotwin/eval_files
bash eval.sh task_name demo_clean my_test_v1 0 0
```

⚠️ **Note:** It is recommended to run tests in parallel to shorten the time needed to complete all tasks. We provide code and scripts for parallel testing `./parallel_eval/eval_notebook.sh`. Please modify them.


# 🚀 Reproduce Training Results
## 📦 Step0: Download the training dataset
Download the RoboTwin 2.0 datasets from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/StarVLA/RoboTwin-Randomized) to to your own data directory.


## 🚀 Step1: Start Training
Most of the required training files have been organized in [train_files](train_files).  

Please run the following command to start training, the total batch size is `48x4`:
```bash
bash examples/Robotwin/train_files/run_robotwin_train.sh
```
